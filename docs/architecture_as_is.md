# Architecture (as-is) — blocked

## Status

The canonical source for the current behavior is `src/gem_clicker.ahk`. In this repository snapshot, that file is empty (0 bytes), so there is no executable logic to analyze or document. Any description of timers, OCR pipeline, click logic, recovery logic, or freeze detection would require inventing behavior, which is explicitly disallowed.

## Next step required

Restore/import the actual v8.7j implementation of `src/gem_clicker.ahk` so the as-is architecture can be documented without guessing.
